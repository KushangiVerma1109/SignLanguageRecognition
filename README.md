# SignLanguageRecognition
# Sign language recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves capturing images or video frames of hand signs and processing them through a deep learning model.
# The CNN extracts relevant features from the input data through multiple layers of convolution and pooling operations.
# These features are then flattened and passed through fully connected layers to classify the signs into specific categories. 
# The model is trained on a labeled dataset of sign language gestures, allowing it to learn and recognize patterns associated with different signs.
# Once trained, the CNN can accurately identify and interpret sign language in real-time applications.
